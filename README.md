# clWeather
clWeather is a command line application that queries the National Weather Service API (https://api.weather.gov) and receives a response of the local weather report for a given station.  

In its current configuration, KFWB is currently set as the station to query.  Upcoming changes will include the ability to pass the station ID as an argument when making the request.
